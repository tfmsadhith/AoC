Hey there! This repository contains a whole lot of solutions to the Advent of Code problems. I hope that they are of some use, I have put in great effort to make the programs as readable as possible. 

I don't really follow the Advent of Code schedule, preferring to solve them whenever I wish (we don't really have seasons in Singapore after all!)

If you have any feedback, feel free to email me at sanjay.adhith@u.nus.edu.
